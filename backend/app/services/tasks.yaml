    Analyze the provided 'Parental Input' (see below) regarding their desires for a
    children's picture book. Your sole objective is to transform this input into a meticulously

    If information for a specific point is not found in the input, you MUST explicitly state
    'Not specified by parent' for that point. Do NOT invent or infer information beyond what is provided.
